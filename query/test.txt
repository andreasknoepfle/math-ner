  In this paper we present an algorithm for computing <tag name="MATH" value="start"/>Hecke eigensystems<tag name="MATH" value="end"/> of
Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number
one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field
$\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify <tag name="MATH" value="start"/>Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms<tag name="MATH" value="end"/> that
are possible lifts from <tag name="MATH" value="start"/>Hilbert eigenforms<tag name="MATH" value="end"/>.
  It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to
the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a
quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It
is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between
observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of
quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful
for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum
coherence.
  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory
of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical
view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the <tag name="MATH" value="start"/>Heisenberg
equations/relations<tag name="MATH" value="end"/> for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the <tag name="MATH" value="start"/>Heisenberg
equations<tag name="MATH" value="end"/> and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.
